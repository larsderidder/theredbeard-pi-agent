# GitHub Skill

Use the `gh` CLI to interact with GitHub. Always specify `--repo owner/repo` when not in a git directory, or use URLs directly.

## Important Restrictions

**Do not push without explicit user approval.** Ask for permission if the commits, tags, or branches to push have not already been authorized. Do not ask again for the same authorized scope.

**Do not post GitHub content without explicit user permission.** This includes comments, issues, PRs, reviews, and releases. Present the proposed action and content and ask for scoped approval when needed, especially in Lars-owned or internal projects. After approval, execute the authorized action rather than requiring Lars to post it manually. Explicit approval of a clearly described workflow covers the GitHub actions named in that workflow; ask before expanding its scope.

## Pull Requests

Check CI status on a PR:
```bash
gh pr checks 55 --repo owner/repo
```

List recent workflow runs:
```bash
gh run list --repo owner/repo --limit 10
```

View a run and see which steps failed:
```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo
```

View logs for failed steps only:
```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo --log-failed
```

## API for Advanced Queries

The `gh api` command is useful for accessing data not available through other subcommands.

Get PR with specific fields:
```bash
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/55 --jq '.title, .state, .user.login'
```

## JSON Output

Most commands support `--json` for structured output.  You can use `--jq` to filter:

```bash
gh issue list --repo owner/repo --json number,title --jq '.[] | "\(.number): \(.title)"'
```
